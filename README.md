# Study-on-Handwritten-Character-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
Abstractâ€” Study on Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) is the most challenging task in image classification because of different type of writing styles and same type of character design which is difficult to differentiate and also there is no model available for multiple language character recognition because when number of classes increase then model performance will decrease. There are many techniques available for Handwritten Character Recognition. For this problem, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is best technique to use. In this model, two CNN layers is used with tanh and relu activation function. Values of kernel size, filter, batch size and epoch are tuned and we get more accuracy then the existing model. In this model, we are using the public available dataset of multiple languages for recognition which contain Hindi characters (include consonant and Hindi Numerals), English characters (include capital and small alphabet with numbers), Bangla characters (include vowel, consonant and Bangla numerals), and all the mathematical symbols. The performance of the proposed approach was analyzed for all the dataset separately and combined. achieved accuracy for English dataset is 99.54%, for Hindi dataset is 98.60%, for Bangla dataset is 87.10% and for math symbol dataset is 99.08% and achieved accuracy for combined dataset is 97.34%.
